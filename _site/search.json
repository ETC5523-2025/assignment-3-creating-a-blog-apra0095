    "text": "Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) remained a major burden on hospital systems by causing long-term disability, especially in Germany. From the 2011 ECDC point-prevalence survey, enabled Germany to be analysed using a new methodology, the Burden of Healthcare-Associated Infections (BHAI) R package. This method translates prevalence into disability adjusted life years (DALYs), combining years of life lost (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD), providing a clearer picture of population health impact.\nThe fundamental question is: How big is Germany’s HAI burden compared with EU/EEA average and what infection type drives it?"
